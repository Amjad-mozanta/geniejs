GenieJS
=======

Genie effect in a browser. The genie.js library doesn't require any additional libraries (e.g. jQuery to work). However a conveniance jQuery plugin is also included that wraps calls to genieJS. In order to perform genie effect transitions on HTML elements (not just images) the html2canvas.js library is also required.
